<div class="FilledIn2">
    I feel that I have completed everything that this assignment requires.
    I did the save and load feature, all the required dice and score amounts, all the
    data displayed for the user that was required.
    I did not add anything extra like four of a kind or the rest of the rules that Yahtzee has, but were not required for the assignment

<div class="FilledIn2">
    the main data structure is an object named game with many member variables and methods
    that describe how the game functions like the state and number of dice and other variables and tasks.
    16 variables with 6 being arrays. 9 functions with 3 being only used inside the object itself in other functions

<div class="FilledIn2">
    I learned that javascript can be very convenient with its flexibility, if worked with correctly.
    Loops are very convenient to set values for saving and loading variables or to loop over many repeat variables.
